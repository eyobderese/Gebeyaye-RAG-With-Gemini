# RAG-Based Chatbot

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot using the LangChain framework and Google's Generative AI models. The chatbot provides context-aware responses to user queries.

It implmeted in two ways:

1. Plane Python (only used the language model)
2. Using the LangChain framework

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `plane_python/`: Contains the implementation of the chatbot using only the language model.
- `langchain/`: Contains the implementation of the chatbot using the LangChain framework.
- `plane_python/requirements.txt`: Contains the required dependencies for the project.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: An open-source library for Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- **LangChain**: A framework for building conversational AI systems.
- **Google's Generative AI Models**: Pre-trained models for generating human-like text.
